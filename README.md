# MyComicsFullProject
An in development, for personal use, comic book database for android.

This is my first app, so try not to judge me or my code too harshly.  Mostly a learning experience.

By the end, it should operate like so:
It opens up to all characters the user owns.  Should display character name and an image of the users choosing.  A button on the bottom should allow the user to add a character. Clicking on the image should allow the user to change it from the gallery.  Clicking on the name should take the user to a new activity that shows what Series' the user owns based on that character.  Holding the name should prompt the user to delete the character.
The series screen should look similar to the character screen, only it shows Series titles.  Behaves the same as well.  Clicking a series shows a new screen that displays the issue numbers the user has.

Currenlty, it operates like so:
Everything works, except for the remove function on any view.

Thoughts:
Should use a better structure for saving data.
Will improve asthetics once it works properly.
Add sort function for character and series.
Should clean up code.  Right now it is ductaped together.
Currently very "brute forced".
Come up with a more astheticaly pleasing way to display issues.

Possible future modifications/new apps:
More information such as publisher.
Implement API databases.
Output a text file that can be sent to an email so the user can print it and take it with them.
Use a barecode scanner to get information.
Maybe do away with current strucure, and just have an option to display by Publisher, Character, Series, etc.
